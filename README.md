real-time network packet analyzer to capture, inspect, and classify network traffic using deep packet inspection techniques.
# Real-Time Network Packet Analyzer and Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Overview

This project is a real-time network packet analyzer with built-in anomaly detection capabilities. It captures and inspects network traffic, performs protocol analysis, and uses machine learning models to detect abnormal patterns that may indicate potential security threats such as DDoS attacks, port scans, or suspicious payloads.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time packet capturing and decoding (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- 📊 Live network traffic statistics and visualization
- 🧠 Anomaly detection using ML algorithms
